= An OASP4Js Application

== My Thai Star basics
As an example of how an OASP4J application is built we are going to show the _My Thai Star_ application frontend project, that can be found https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star[in github].

_My Thai Star_ application is a solution for managing the online booking and orders of a restaurant, it is addressed as a showcase app but designed with real requirements and, moreover, trying to serve as an example of common use cases in web apps (Routing with and without guards, use of flex-box, theming, re-usable components, mock back end...).

* Book a table.
* Create an event and invite some friends to it via email.
* See the menu of dishes and with the reservationId make their own orders.

- Logged users also can:
* If the user has the role _waiter_, he will be able to access to a restricted area to see and filter the list and details of all the reservations and orders made by the users.
