= Deployment of OASP4Fn applications
The deployment is performed by the serverless framework and it's quite simple, you only have to run the following command to deploy the full service:

`sls deploy`

[IMPORTANT]
====
This command will fail if the AWS credentials are missing. For more information see https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/[serverless credentials]
====

When the deploy is finish with no errors, you will have a command line output with the endpoints and the functions deployed.

In the case that you have a lot of handlers to deploy, and you make a little change to a handler, there is no necessary to deploy again all the handlers, only the modified one using this command:

`sls deploy function -f <your_function_name>`

[NOTE]
====
You can get more information about the deployment in the https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/[serverless documentation].
