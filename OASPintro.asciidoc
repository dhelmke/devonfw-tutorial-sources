= The Open Application Standard Platform; an introduction

The http://oasp.github.io/index.html[Open Application Standard] Platform is a solution for the development of business applications that combines a set of tools and libraries with best practices and code conventions.

So Oasp is not only a framework but a combination of IDEs, plugins, libraries and customized tools with the recommended procedures for implementing stable and maintainable web applications.

For _Java_ based backend solutions, Oasp includes http://oasp.github.io/oasp4j_content/oasp4j_overview.html[_OASP 4 Java_](OASP4J) that provides a standardized architecture blueprint, an open best-of-breed technology stack as well as industry proven best practices and code conventions for a cloud ready _SPRING_ based server.

== OASP4J

Included in _Devon_ framework as default server solution, https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j[_OASP4J_] is the result of applying OASP principles in a Java based technology stack. With _OASP4J_ developers are able to create web application backends in a fast and reliable way, generating web services (REST, SOAP) that web clients can consume.

=== Oasp4j Technology stack

As mentioned before, Oasp4j is not only a framework but a set of tools and conventions. Oasp4j provides a Java backend solution based on the following technologies:

- https://spring.io/[Spring framework] as the main development framework

- https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/[Spring Boot] as project accelerator.

- https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] as project and dependencies management tool. The _Maven_ projects use the _POM_ file to store all the necessary information for building the project (project configuration, dependencies, plugins, etc.). You can get more details about _POM_ files https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#What_is_the_POM[here].


Some of the main features of _Spring Boot_ are

- Creation of stand-alone Spring applications in an easy way.

- Embedded Tomcat directly (no need to deploy WAR files).

- Provide 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration.

- Automatically configure Spring (whenever possible).

- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration.

- No requirement for XML configuration

For _persistence_ and _data access_ Oasp4j implements:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API[JPA] and http://hibernate.org/[Hibernate]
- http://www.querydsl.com/[QueryDsl] as query manager
- http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html[H2] instance embedded as _out-of-the-box_ database that is launched each time the application is started so the developers are able to start working with a real data access from scratch.
- https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway] as a tool for version control of the database.

As service framework
- http://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] that provides support for
** REST services through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services[JAX-RS]
** SOAP services through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services[JAX-WS]

=== Oasp4j tools

==== IDE
As part of the _Devon_ framework Oasp4j projects are integrated in a customized Eclipse instance that provides pre-configurations and pre-installed plugins focusing on code quality and productivity boosting.

==== Devon Tools
Apart from all the methodologies regarding the mentioned frameworks, inside the Devon/Oasp ecosystem there are another tools that are crucial for boosting the productivity and enhance the managing of the Java projects.

- Cobigen: a generic incremental generator for end to end code generation that will allow us to automate the generation of the main parts of the components of our apps. Starting from an Entity, Cobigen can generate all its CRUD functionality for us, starting from the service and ending up in the persistance data layer.

- Devcon: a Devon internal tool to manage Devon based projects. Among many other tasks, it can create, run or deploy Oasp4j applications avoiding users to do it manually.

=== Oasp4j architecture overview

Oasp4j provides a solution for industrialized web apps based on _components_ and a three-layers architecture.

A _component_ is a package that contains the services and logic related to one feature of the app.

Each component will be divided in three layers: _service_, _logic_ and _dataacess_.

- Service Layer: will expose the REST api to exchange information with the client applications.

- Logic Layer: the layer in charge of hosting the business logic of the application.

- Data Access Layer: the layer to communicate with the data base.

Finally the _Oasp4j_ applications provide a _general_ package to locate the cross-cutting functionalities such as _security_, _logging_ or _exception handling_.

In the next chapters you can find all the details about the implementation of each layer and how to develop all the relevant parts of a web app based on _Devon_ framework and _Oasp4j_.
