http://devonfw.github.io/index.html[Devon framework] is a development platform that provides a standardized architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide an fully functional _out-of-the-box_ development environment.

== Zip

The Devonfw distributions can be obtained from the https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/listReleases/projects.apps2_devon/frs.devon_distribution[TeamForge releases library] and are packaged in a _zip_ file that includes all the needed tools, software and configurations.

== No installation, no configuration

Having all the dependencies serf-contained in the distribution's _zip_ file, users don't need to install or configure anything. Just extracting the _zip_ content is enough to have a fully functional _Devonfw_.

== Pre installed software

The list of software pre-installed with Devonfw distributions is:

- _Eclipse_: pre-configured and fully functional IDE to develop Java based apps.

- _Java_: all the Java environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Maven_: to manage project dependencies.

- _Node_: a Node js environment configured and ready to be used within the distribution.

- _Sencha_: Devonfw also includes a installation of the _Sencha Cmd_ tool.
