== General concept

The idea of the Getting Started Guides is to function as an introduction & tutorial. 

The idea is to show how a real applciation, _My Thai Star_, is built up. From general overview & architecture to detailing individual layers, _My Thai Star_ is shown to hightlight how to create a devonfw app. For each part a practical part is included. This is based on a(n extremely) minimal application, "snatch-a-snack". This app consists of a single view offering a single function, doing a single db operation.
