= Testing of OASP4Fn applications
In this chapter we are going to learn how to tests applications in OASP4Fn using the http://mochajs.org/[mocha] framework and the http://chaijs.com/[chai] assertion library.

= Install global dependencies
As the title says in this section we're going to specify the global dependencies that we need to run our tests, that only are the test framework and the typescript interpreter:

```
yarn global add mocha
yarn global add ts-node
```

No more dependencies are needed, because we start our project with the oasp4fn application template and the local part of the test dependencies are specified as dev-dependencies at the _package.json_.
