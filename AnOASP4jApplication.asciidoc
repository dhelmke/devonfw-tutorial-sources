= An OASP4J Application

== My Thai Star basics
As an example of how an OASP4J application is built we are going to show the _My Thai Star_ application backend project, that can be found https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star[in github].

The _My Thai Star_ application is a solution for managing the online booking and orders of a restaurant, it is addressed as a showcase app but designed with real requirements although trying to serve as example of common use cases in web apps (master-detail model, login, authorization based on roles, pagination, search with filters, etc.).

The main features of the app are:

- anonymous users can book a table.

- anonymous users can create an event and invite some friends to the restaurant.

- users can visit the food catalog and see information about the available dishes (name, ingredients, picture, price). 

- both, the host and the guests, can order food for the event based on the food catalog and can select dishes with extra ingredients.

- all the booking and order creation / cancellation operations are related to mail notifications sent by the application to warn the involved users about the changes.

- only users with role _waiter_ are able to access to a restricted area of the application to have access to a list with all of the bookings and orders and can access to the details of each one.

- the waiters can filter the bookings/orders results to manage the list.

== My Thai Star Oasp4j Backend overview

My Thai Star project is hosted https://github.com/devonfw/my-thai-star[on github] and includes different technologies such as _Java_, _.Net_ and _Node_ for backend solutions and _Angular_ and _Xamarin_ as default clients.

[NOTE]
====
*Where are we going to store the mythaistar app? in the Devon distribution? in a public repo?*
====

Using the OASP4J approach for the Java backend project we will have a structure of a Maven project formed by two projects

In the _core_ project we will store all the logic and functionality of the application
